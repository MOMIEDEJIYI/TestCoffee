						<div id="awser">
							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One popular story about the discovery of coffee long ago is about Kaldi, a keeper of goats Kaldi was taking care of his goats in the highlands of Ethiopia where coffee trees have grown for centuries. He noticed that his goats became very excited and active after eating small fruits from a tree.
		Kaldi reported this discovery to a group of religious workers. When they made a drink out of the fruit, the religious workers realized they could stay awake for long hours of prayer. This knowledge about coffee soon spread all over the world.

						<div id="question" class="text-center">
							<p>
								Let's take a look at the disadvantages of coffee<br>
							</p>
						</div>
						
						<div id="awser">
							<p>
								1.nervous chaos. Caffeine improves alertness, alertness, memory and concentration. But drinking more coffee than you're used to can produce a similar dose of stimulant that can cause jitters. For people prone to anxiety disorder, caffeine can worsen symptoms like sweaty palms, heart palpitations, and ringing in the ears.							
							</p>
							<p>
								2.Aggravating hypertension. Caffeine is often combined with other simple analgesics because of its analgesic properties, but long-term use of large amounts of caffeine can only make your condition worse if you already have high blood pressure. Because caffeine alone can raise blood pressure, which, when combined with stress, can multiply dangerously, people at risk for high blood pressure should especially avoid caffeinated beverages during stressful times at work. Some long-time coffee drinkers may think they are immune to the effects of caffeine, but this is not the case, with one study showing that blood pressure can rise for up to 12 hours after drinking a cup of coffee.	
							</p>
							<p>
								3.induce osteoporosis. Caffeine itself has a good diuretic effect. If you drink coffee for a long time and in large quantities, it is easy to cause bone loss, which will adversely affect the preservation of bone mass, and may increase the threat of osteoporosis for women. But the premise is that the lack of intake of adequate calcium in the usual food, or people who do not move often, plus post-menopausal women, due to lack of estrogen caused by calcium loss, the above situation plus a large amount of caffeine, may pose a threat to bone. If you enjoy it in reasonable amounts, you can still avoid eating for fear of choking.
